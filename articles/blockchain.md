## Mining yourself

So now that you know some cryto currencies. Lets try mining some yourself. You can try mining some yourself without even understanding the mathematics involved behind it. Which you can learn later of course and i would advise you to do so for your own personal culture.

First lets explain briefly what is mining. Mining is really trying to solve very difficult mathematical problems. It is used as a proof of work because once enough computers are mining it becomes very difficult to fake transactions since it would need the computer to have more than 50% of computer power of all miners combined. Because of the computer power needed to mine, miners get rewarded some of the crypto currency for proctecting the blockchain and spending computer power which explains the hype behind it.

So now, what if you want to mine some crypto currency? You can use some free source software to mine for you. It would advise you to have a solid GPU to use it because it might not be worth the effot most of the time given the expenses of power maintenance. But anyway lets assume that you have the device for such usage. You can find some free minors online on Github for instance like the one im showing you called XMRrig. You can find online documentation on how to use it for those a little less tech saavy. There are also few tutorials on youtube on how to use it.

Also, you can use docker to mine yourself which is a little easier since once you have docker installed you can launch it with one command in your terminal. For instance the one im showing is designed to mine monero.

## NFT
So what are NFTs? Lets start from the beginning.

NFT stands for Non fungible token. It is a a kind of digital signature written on a blockchain. Its purpose is to certifie that a digital assets belongs to you and not anyone else so it guarantees the uniqueness of your owernership.

NFTs have been used to sign digital items like photos videos, audios and any digital files of the sort videos, audios and any digital files of the sort. Access to copies of the bought NFT item are not restricted to the buyer so anyone can have a copy but the proof owernership of the NFT is written on the blockchain.

NFTs have been used more and more recently and the main blockchain used to store them is Ethereum.

In 2020 the market value of NFTs has tripled reaching more than 250 million dollars.

Here's the most valuable NFT item ever bought called "Everyday - the first 5000 days".

So I don't know about you but the idea of having people spending $70 millions for images that you can download online right now for free is just mind blowing.
