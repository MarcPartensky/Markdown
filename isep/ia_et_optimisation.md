# IA et optimisation

## Nelder-Mead method = downhill simplex 
Finds the minmum of an objective function using the notion of simplex.

## Centroid

$$ x = \sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_i) $$

## Powell's algorithm
Powell's method, strictly Powell's conjugate direction method, is an algorithm proposed by Michael J. D. Powell for finding a local minimum of a function. The function need not be differentiable, and no derivatives are taken.
